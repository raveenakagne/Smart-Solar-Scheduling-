# Smart-Solar-Scheduling
This involves a comprehensive process
that begins with the collection and integration of weather data
and solar energy production and consumption data from home
solar panels. The research focuses
on data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis
using Python to prepare the data for model development. The
project employed a variety of machine learning models, including
linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector
machines, and gradient boosting machines, to identify the most
effective method for predicting solar availability and planning
energy usage. The project includes performance evaluation metrics to select the optimal model. This best model is used for
the development of a user-friendly Tableau dashboard that helps
homeowners make informed decisions about the best times to
charge and use energy based on solar generation
forecasts. The project aims to enhance the sustainability and
efficiency of solar energy in homes
